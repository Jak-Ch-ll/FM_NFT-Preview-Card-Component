## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

At first, I put the clock and Etherium icons in the markup, which created a mess of CSS classes. I even experimented with separating the meta-information bar into a separate component from a BEM standpoint. When working on the hover effect with the eye icon, I immediately decided to put it in a pseudo-element because it has no real semantic meaning. While taking a break, I realised that this might be the better approach for the other icons, too.

Please let me know if you know of any downsides with loading icons via CSS compared to HTML.
