## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM Methodology
- Flexbox
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

At first, I put the clock and Etherium icons in the markup, which created a mess of CSS classes. I even experimented with separating the meta-information bar into a separate component from a BEM standpoint. When working on the hover effect with the eye icon, I immediately decided to put it in a pseudo-element because it has no real semantic meaning. While taking a break, I realised that this might be the better approach for the other icons, too.
